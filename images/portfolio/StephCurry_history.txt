‘I’ve never been afraid of big moments. I get butterflies. I get nervous and anxious, but I think those are all good signs that I’m ready for the moment’ – Stephen Curry. 

Stephen Curry was intent in showing the world that he was not just ‘lucky’ – he wanted to show that he deserved to be playing in the Finals. He deserved to be the MVP. He deserved to win a championship. He deserved to be recognized as one of the greatest players to ever play this game.
