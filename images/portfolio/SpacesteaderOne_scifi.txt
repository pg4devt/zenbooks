Welcome aboard Spacesteader One, humanity's last refuge from extinction. Thrust from a dying Earth, this first of thirteen planned missions left our solar system carrying teams of cryogenically stored spacesteaders expecting eons of peaceful sleep. Instead, Commander Anna Martinez awakens to a blaring alarm and a dozen brutal murders. Is this a sabotage perpetrated by the two cult members suspected of posing as spacesteaders, a faction hell bent on preventing humankind from polluting other worlds? Or is it a burgeoning mutiny by the powerful mobile androids, aka mandroids, a dexterous ensemble left tending the ship in solitude for nearly seventy years as the crew lay sleeping? These two devoted factions may even share a common goal. Find out as you venture the depths of human conflict aboard Spacesteader One
